<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks are miRNA expression levels of 78 primary cell types and 51 cancer/immortalized cell lines. Data was obtained from multiple sources.  The first source was from <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2017/09/06/gr.222067.117.long" target="_blank">McCall MN et al</a>.
 Cells were generally grown in culture or were flow sorted. The second source was <a href="https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v35/n9/full/nbt.3947.html" target="_blank">FANTOM5</a> data, which was obtained from commercially purchased primary cell lines grown in culture.
 The third source was from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/4080663" target="_blank">Juzenas et al</a>. The isolation technique was magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) from total blood.  Additional cancer cell lines were obtained from SRA from more recent
 submissions including several from the Oncolory Network Bioresource Core Faility cell lines. From the first source, all samples had
 greater than 1 million miRNA reads.  For the additional sources, all samples had > 500,000 miRNA reads. Each cell type may be the average of several similar cells or the data from
 a single cell line/culture. That can be noted on the more detailed graph. Some cell types sequenced by the other groups will not appear here as they had <500,000 miRNA reads. In total, 545 RNA-seq data sets were used from across the sources. Data is expressed in reads per million miRNA reads (RPM) through analysis performed through the miRNA alignment software <a href="http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html">miRge</a>. This data is not otherwise normalized.  

<p>A separate processing step was carried out, although not part of the display, which normalized across all samples via the RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation) process. Please see Process 2 in
 the Methods section for more information. This data is not log normalized.</p>
<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
	
<p>Primary cell tracks are colored black and cancer cells tracks are colored red. The data is best viewed with a "pack" configuration and individual sample tracks can be toggled on or off. Clicking on a given sample will reveal additional information about the sample including the RUV score value.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Process 1</h3>

Data was obtained from the Sequence Read Archive or from primary cells grown in culture.  Fastq files were processed with <a href="http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html">miRge</a> for counting miRNAs. miRNAs were normalized to reads per million miRNA reads (RPM).

<h3>Process 2</h3>
	
Additional processing was performed with the Remove Unwanted Variation (RUV) method to normalize across samples. The miRNA matrix file with RUV values for each miRNA for each data sets can be found here: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhalushka/UCSC_miRNA_barchart/master/hg38/miRNA_primary_RUV_matrix.txt">Primary cells</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhalushka/UCSC_miRNA_barchart/master/hg38/miRNA_cancer_RUV_matrix.txt">Cancer cells</a>.
